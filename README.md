###### Vizag
My favorite place is vizag because of it's long coastal line and it is one of the best places to live in India. I am a huge admirer of nature. I can spend the whole day at the beach. Visakhapatnam has given me the opportunity to live in harmony with nature. From its gushing beaches to the **lush green mountains,the city** has many places to visit with our loved ones to spend some quality time. Vizag, the synonym of beauty {well, at least for us} is one of the best places to live in india and you only realise it once you live here. If you have growth up in some city other than Visakhapatnam, these are the thing you will notice once you come and start living here.
